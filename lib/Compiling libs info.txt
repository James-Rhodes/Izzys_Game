The web version of box2d was compiled using this guide
https://openbase.com/js/box2d-wasm/documentation

- basically compile box2d wasm in intermediate steps. At one point a .a file is compiled and thats what you need.
- compiling raylib for web was standard, same for normal raylib.
- Compiling box2d was also standard however you must change the compiler to mingw for it to compile to .a as far as I know

The links to Box2d and Raylib can be found below:

https://github.com/raysan5/raylib

https://github.com/erincatto/box2d

The required names for each .a (library file is as follows):
- raylib: libraylib.a 
- raylib for web: libraylib_web.a
- box2d: libbox2d.a
- box2d for web: libbox2d_web.a

Simply place these files in the lib folder and type make into the command line to build the project
