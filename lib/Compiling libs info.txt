The web version of box2d was compiled using this guide
https://openbase.com/js/box2d-wasm/documentation

- basically compile box2d wasm in intermediate steps. At one point a .a file is compiled and thats what you need.
- compiling raylib for web was standard, same for normal raylib.
- Ccompiling box2d was also standard however you must change the compiler to mingw for it to compile to .a as far as I know
